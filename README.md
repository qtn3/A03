Part 1: Direction of using Webstorm

  1) Download Webstorm from the website called: https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students 

  2) Click the button called "Apply Now", fill in all the needed information, and then click "Apply For Free Products" 

  3) Install Webstorm follow the instructions

  4) Open Webstorm by clicking on the app icon

  5) Create the first project by clicking on the plus sign named "New Project"

  6) Give the first project a name, a location to store it, and click the button named "Create"

  7) To create the first file (in this case is HTML5 file) on the left panel, you right-click on the name of the folder which you did create on Step 6 and choose 
     "New" -> "HTML5"

  8) Give the file a name (in this case is index.html)

  9) Inside the index.html file, you need to give it some content

  10) To check to see if the webpage works correctly or not, on the right side there is a little box contains different browsers inside (Chrome, Safari, Firefox,         Mozilla,...), choose whatever browser you prefer to display the webpage.

Import file to Github:

  11) On the topmost, find the tab named "VCS" (stands for Version Control System), click on that and choose "Import into Version Control", mouse over it and you         will see a panel display next to it, choose "Create Git Repository..." then choose the index.html file

  12) Now when you click on the "VCS" tab, there should be a new tab named "Git" show up (if you do not see the new tab, inside the "VCS" tab, there is a tab named       "Enable Version Control Integration...", click on that and in the dropdown menu choose "Git" and then click "OK", make sure you downloaded Git into computer)

  13) When you mouse over the "Git" tab inside the "VCS" tab, choose "Commit Files...", choose index.html file from the left panel, and click the "Commit" button

  14) To push it on Github, in the "VCS" tab, mouse over "Import into Version Control", then choose "Share Project on Github" (you need to fill in the username and       password), and click the "Share" button (there should be a message pop-up at the bottom right corner tell you that you "Successfully shared project on Github"

  15) Log in to Github and the new repository with the index.html file should be inside

      Download Git on https://git-scm.com/ and then follow the install instructions

Part 2: Git and Github Terms:

1)	Branch: A branch is essentially is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches. The main branch — the one where all changes eventually get merged back into and is called master.

2)	Clone: Cloning a repository means that you're downloading a copy of the source code from source control. 

3)	Commit: A Git commit is a snapshot of the hierarchy (Git tree) and the contents of the files (Git blob) in a Git repository. These endpoints allow you to read and write commit objects to your Git database on GitHub.

4)	Fetch: The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on.

5)	GIT: Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.

6)	Github: GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.

7)	Merge: Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

8)	Merge Conflict: A merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.

9)	Push: The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.

10)	Pull: Pull grabs any changes from the GitHub repository and merges them into your local repository.

11)	Remote: A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes.

12)	Repository: A directory or storage space where your projects can live. Sometimes GitHub users shorten this to “repo.” It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, image files, you name it, inside a repository.
